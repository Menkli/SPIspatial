# SPIspatial
This package contains three functions that should be used in consecutive order:

## load_ncdf 
Can be used to load a netCDF file and prints its metadata to the console. 

## build_brick  
It builds a raster brick from the loaded netCDF. The dimensions of the brick (x,y,z) must be read by the user from the metadata printed by load_ncdf. It populates each cell in the brick with the data contained in the netCDF, usually precipitation data.  

## SPIspatial
It calculates the SPI for each timestep in every cell. When the input brick has 100 layers (z-dimension), the resulting SPI raster brick will also consist of about 100 layers (sometimes diverging due to parametrization).
